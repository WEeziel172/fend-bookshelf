# MyReads Project

This application lets you upkeep your own bookshelf. You are able to find newbooks for you to read, and additionally upkeep their current status, E.G; Reading, Read and want to read.

## To start the application

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## How to use
You will have a set of books assigned to you at the start, each with their own status. You can find new books by pressing the "+" on the bottom right corner and searching new books for you.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
